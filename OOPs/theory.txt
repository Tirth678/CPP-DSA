Classes and Objects

objects: are real life enteties 
class: is like a huge blueprint of these enteties

objects can have properties
such as 
here teacher is an object and it has some properties and methods(functions)

teacher{
    name, dept, subject, salary, changedip()
}

class = blue print
object = teacher
now we can create multiple objects with properties
 
Acess Modifiers:
Private = date and methods accessible inside class
Public = date and methods accessible to everyone
Protected = data and methods acessible inside class and to its derived class

By default in C++ everything is private, so writing public is must
